      </div>

      <div>
        Address book, calendar and contact information, which we only collect with your permission.
        bosmetrics may access your contact list available on your mobile device, in your email
        accounts or other information system you connect with the Service in order to locate your
        friends, contacts and employees on the Service and to invite them to register with our
        Service. With your permission, we may integrate our Service with your calendar system (such

        We may also collect information about you that is publicly available.
      </div>

      <div>
        We will only use personal information to provide you with information, products, or services
        you have requested, or for other purposes set out in this Policy. Personal information does
        not include aggregate information from which individual identities have been removed.
      </div>

      <div>
        1.2 Information from Children. bosmetrics does not knowingly solicit or collect any personal
        information from anyone under 13 years of age, and children under 13 are not permitted to
        register for or use our Site or Services, including by subscribing to receive information
        from bosmetrics. Parents can contact our customer service department to access, change, or
        delete the personal information that has been submitted by a child. If we become aware that
        a child under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information, we will delete it.
      </div>

      <div>
        1.3 Cookies and Tracers. We, and our third party partners, automatically collect certain
        types of usage information when you visit our Services, read our emails, or otherwise engage
        with us. We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies,
        including cookies, Flash objects, web beacons, file information and similar technology
        (collectively, “tracking technologies”). For example, we collect information about your
        device and its software, such as your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider,
        platform type, device type, operating system, date and time stamp, a unique ID that allows
        us to uniquely identify your browser, mobile device or your account, and other such
        information. We also collect information about the way you use our Service, for example, the
        site from which you came and the site to which you are going when you leave our website, the
        pages you visit, the links you click, how frequently you access the Service, whether you
        open emails or click the links contained in emails, whether you access the Service from
        multiple devices, and other actions you take on the Service. When you access our Service
        from a mobile device, we may collect unique identification numbers associated with your
        device or our mobile application (including, for example, a UDID, Unique ID for Advertisers
        (“IDFA”), Google AdID, or Windows Advertising ID), mobile carrier, device type, model and
        manufacturer, mobile device operating system brand and model, phone number, and depending on
        your mobile device settings, your geographical location data, including GPS coordinates
        (e.g., latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your
        mobile device, or we may be able to approximate a device’s location by analyzing other
        information, like an IP address. We may collect analytics data, or use third-party analytics
        tools, to help us measure traffic and usage trends for the Service and to understand more
        about the demographics of our users. We may also work with third party partners to employ
        technologies, including the application of statistical modeling tools, which attempt to
        recognize you across multiple devices. Although we do our best to honor the privacy
        preferences of our users, we are unable to respond to Do Not Track signals set by your
        browser at this time.
      </div>

      <div>
        We use or may use the data collected through tracking technologies to: (a) remember
        information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you
        visit the site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information, including targeted
        content and advertising; (c) identify you across multiple devices; (d) provide and monitor
        the effectiveness of our Service; (e) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of
        visitors, traffic, usage, and demographic patterns on our website; (f) diagnose or fix
        technology problems; and (g) otherwise to plan for and enhance our service.
      </div>

      <div>
        If you would prefer not to accept cookies, most browsers will allow you to: (i) change your
        browser settings to notify you when you receive a cookie, which lets you choose whether or
        not to accept it; (ii) disable existing cookies; or (iii) set your browser to automatically
        reject cookies. Please note that doing so may negatively impact your experience using the
        Service, as some features and services on our Service may not work properly. Depending on
        your mobile device and operating system, you may not be able to delete or block all cookies.
        You may also set your e-mail options to prevent the automatic downloading of images that may
        contain technologies that would allow us to know whether you have accessed our e-mail and
        performed certain functions with it.
      </div>

      <div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>2. How Information May Be Shared</div>

      <div>
        bosmetrics will never sell or rent any of your personal information, and we will never share
        your personal information publicly without your consent. However, we may share your
        information with certain trusted third-party services to help us provide, improve, promote,
        or protect our products and Services. For example, we may partner with other companies to
        process your payments or store your data to support delivery of our products or Services.
        Whenever we share data with third-party services, we require that they use your information
        only for the purposes we’ve authorized, and that they protect your personal information at
        least to the same standards we do.
      </div>

      <div>
        We may also share your information with other users of the service. For example, some of
        your information may be shared with your employer and with other employees of the same
        employer in order to facilitate scheduling, timekeeping and communication. We may also share
        information about your use of the Service with your employer for analytic purposes. For
        example, we provide reporting tools to allow an employer to evaluate the efficiency of its
        workforce, and its employees’ responsiveness and availability;
      </div>

      <div>
        We also reserve the right to disclose personal information when it is reasonably necessary
        to conduct our business, protect bosmetrics’s legal rights and property, and to comply with
        the law or law enforcement. Otherwise, your personal information is never shared with any
        individual or other organization.
      </div>

      <div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>3. Protection of your Personal Information</div>

      <div>
        We take the security of your personal information seriously, and follow industry-standard
        practices to protect the data we collect and process. bosmetrics has therefore put in place
        commercially reasonable physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and
        secure the personal information that bosmetrics collects. Access to personal information
        will be restricted to our authorized personnel who require the information in order to
        perform their duties properly. In addition, access will be limited to only that information
        that is strictly necessary for the performance of those duties.
      </div>

      <div>
        Remember, the safety and security of your information also depends on you. Where you have
        chosen, or where we have given you a user name and password for access to certain parts of
        the Site or Services, you are responsible for keeping the user name and password
        confidential. No method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is
        completely secure, so bosmetrics cannot guarantee its absolute security.
      </div>

      <div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>4. Data Transfer</div>

      <div>
        Because bosmetrics is a US-based company, your information may be collected and processed in
        the United States. Additionally, as part of the products and services offered to you through
        our Site, the information which we collect about you may be transferred to, and stored in,
        one or more countries other than where you currently reside. For example, this may occur if
        any of our servers or third-party service providers are located in a country other than
        yours. These countries may have different data protection laws that are similar to your
        current residence. However, if we transfer your information in this way, we will put in
        place appropriate protection to make sure your personal data remains adequately protected
        and is treated in line with this Privacy Policy.
      </div>

      <div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>5. Email Notifications</div>

      <div>
        We try to keep email communications to a minimum, and give you the ability to opt in to any
        marketing communications we send. For example, we may send you email relating to the
        Services we offer. You may also elect to receive certain marketing email communications, in
        accordance with your preferences on your profile settings, and from which you may opt out at
        any time. You can always opt out of receiving email information or mobile device
        notifications from bosmetrics (other than certain required communications informing you of
        the completion of a purchase, user registration, correction of user data, or change of
        password), by logging into your profile on the Services and adjusting your user preferences
        in your account profile, or by sending us an email at support@bosmetrics.com stating your
        request. If we have sent you a promotional email or mobile device notification, you may send
        us a return email or mobile device communication asking to be omitted from future email or
        mobile device distributions. This opt out does not apply to information provided to
        bosmetrics as a result of a purchase of the Services, product service experience, or other
        transactions.
      </div>

      <div>
        When an employer invites an employee to register with the Service, we will send that
        employee a message using the contact information provided by the employer. The employer must
        certify that it has the employee’s consent for bosmetrics to contact the employee on the
        employer’s behalf using that method of communication.
      </div>

      <div>
        If you want to invite your friends, contacts or employees to try out the Service, we will
        send the contact an email, which may include your name and photo to let them know that you
        are the person extending the invitation. After sending these invitations, we may also send
        reminder emails to your invitees on your behalf. We will store these contacts for ease of
        connecting with them on the Service at a later time. We may also provide you the option to
        send invitations via SMS text message. You may not use the Service to send text messages
        unless you have the consent from the recipient to receive text message communications.
      </div>

      <div style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>6. Retention</div>

      <div>
        We will hold your personal information on our systems for as long as is necessary to perform
        the relevant processing activity for that information, or as long as is set out in any
        relevant contract you hold with us. This is a case by case determination that depends on
        things like the nature of the data, why it is collected, why it is processed, and any
        relevant legal or operational retention needs. For example, we may retain your data for as
        long as you maintain an account on our Site so that we may process and deliver your orders.
        We may also be legally required to hold some types of information to fulfil our statutory
        obligations. We review our retention periods for personal information on a regular basis.
        When the relevant processing activity has been completed, we may destroy your data, or
        alternatively anonymize the data in such a way that you are not personally identifiable,
        either directly or indirectly. When you deactivate your account, including if you are
        removed from an employer’s company account, we will remove your information from view by
        others on the Service but we may retain your account information internally so that you can
        access your account history through an individual account and so that you may re-register an
        account with another employer more quickly in the future. You may request to delete your
        account information by contacting us at support@bosmetrics.com. However, please be aware
        that we will not be able to delete any content you have shared with others on the Service.
        For example, your employer will have a record of your schedule when you were employed, and
        will retain the data the employer provided to us about you.
      </div>
